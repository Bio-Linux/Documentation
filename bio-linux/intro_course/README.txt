=== Course description and aims ===

This tutorial introduces the new user to the Bio-Linux system. It includes a tour of the desktop,
information on finding programs and documentation, and provides experience running graphical and
command line tools.
The tutorial material is used in our introductory taught courses but is also designed
to be suitable for self-study.

The tutorial is made up of two parts:

    * Part 1 is an introduction to the Linux desktop and system
    * Part 2 focuses on running bioinformatics programs on Bio-Linux and providing the information
      you need to make intelligent choices about the programs and interfaces you use to run your
      bioinformatics analyses


After working through this tutorial, you should be able to:

    * move around the Bio-Linux system with ease using graphical and command line functions
    * find out about software on the system and how to use it
    * use Linux system and bioinformatics programs in combination to approach your bioinformatics
      work with greater efficiency and ease
    * understand how QIIME and Mothur can be used to analyse marker gene datasets and produce
      diversity statistics
